PHP microframework

This is a small framework designed for REST APIs and simple websites.  It is very lightweight, and has a shallow stack-trace, meaning that applications run fast and application errors are easy to track down.

to add this microframework to your project, you should add it to the 'require' section of composer.json, as follows:

	"require": {
		"willv/project": "^1.0.0"
